May 10 Update

**Left GIF**

- [x] User can scroll through artworks to skim titles, artists, dates, and image. 
- [x] User can tab into any cell to view larger image, title, artist, and date information. 

**Right GIF**

- [x] User can search for any combination of English alphabet and numbers. The search bar successfully only accepts English alphabet and numbers. Inputting other languages will not crash the app. 
- [x] While searching, user can scroll through the search results. The search bar stays on top of the screen without disappering. 
- [ ] Need to implement 'confirm' search function where user can hide the keyboard and continue browsing the searched result.
