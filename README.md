# Browse Art in Art Institute of Chicago

## _#Decolonize This Place_
## Intro/Goal
**I am tired of using art education apps filled with recommendations to browse works by male European artists. I started developing an iOS mobile app where users will be guided to primarily engage with art/artists from underrepresented communities using Art Institute's wonderful API.** üë©üèª‚Äçüíª 

### Language / Tools
* Swift / Xcode
* [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) / [AlarmofireImage](https://cocoapods.org/pods/Alamofire)

### API
* [Art Institute of Chicago's Public API](https://api.artic.edu/docs)
* [IIIF API (Images)](https://api.artic.edu/docs/#iiif-image-api)
